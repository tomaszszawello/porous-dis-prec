""" Collect physical data from the simulation and save/plot them.

This module initializes Data class, storing information about physical data in
the simulation. It stores the data during simulation and afterwards saves them
in a text file and plots them. For now the data are: pressure difference
between input and output (1 / permeability) and quantities of substance B and C
that flowed out of the system.

Notable classes
-------
Data
    container for physical data collected during simulation

TO DO: name data on plots, maybe collect permeability explicitly
