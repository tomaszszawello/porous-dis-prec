""" Calculate pressure and flow in the system.

This module contains functions for solving the Hagen-Poiseuille and continuity
equations for pressure and flow. It assumes constant inflow boundary condition.
It constructs a result vector for the matrix equation (constant throughout the
simulation) and the matrix with coefficients corresponding to aforementioned
equation. Function solve_equation from module utils is used to solve the
equations for flow.
